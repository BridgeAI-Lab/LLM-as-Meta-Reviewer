# LLM-as-Meta-Reviewer Assistants'

## Folder Organization

- **Annotation Files**
  - Contains human annotation for micro and macro evaluation.
- **LLM Responses**
  - This folder contains responses generated by three LLMs (i.e., PalM2, GPT-3.5, and Llama2) for four prompt levels. Here, LLM1, LLM2, and LLM3 represents `PalM2`, `GPT-3.5`, and `Llama2`. The responses are in the columns `res_prompt1`,`res_prompt2`, `res_prompt3`, and `res_prompt4`.
- **GPT Ratings**
  - Contains the ratings given by `GPT-4o` on the LLM generated responses. The human and GPT ratings are merged together in the files. `GPT_rating_LLMx` and `Macro_GPT_score` contains micro and macro evaluation ratings of both human and `GPT-4o` respectively.  
  - `corr_average_likert_ceil` file contains the correlations between human and GPT-4o in micro-evaluation for each LLMs.
- **Meta-Review Data** 
  - The curated dataset used for the meta-review generation. `Review1`, `Review2`, and `Review3` columns have the peer reviews and `Meta_Review` column contain the meta-reviews written by humans.
